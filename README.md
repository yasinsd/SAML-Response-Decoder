## SAML Response Decoder Chrome Extension

### Description
SAML Response Decoder is a Chrome extension that allows users to decode and view SAML responses easily. It's an invaluable tool for support engineers, developers, and administrators working with SAML for authentication and authorization. Additionally, it displays 509 certificate information within the SAML response.
While there are several SAML decoding tools available, the SAML Response Decoder prioritizes user privacy by not automatically detecting SAML responses during login or other operations. Instead, our tool provides a straightforward interface where users can manually paste their SAML responses for decoding. This design choice ensures maximum control for the user and minimizes potential security or privacy concerns.

### Privacy
Your privacy is of utmost importance. All decoding operations are performed locally on your machine; no SAML responses or decoded information are sent to any external servers. Neither the extensionâ€™s developers nor any third parties can access the data you decode using this extension.

### Features
