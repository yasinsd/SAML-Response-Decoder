1. Introduction
Our SAML Response Decoder Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the details of how our Chrome Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information or browsing data of its users.

2. Information We Do Not Collect
We do not collect any personal information from the users of our Chrome Extension. Users are able to use the extension by pasting their SAML response directly into the interface without any need for personal data exchange. No user data is transmitted off the user's device.
